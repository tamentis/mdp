.\" DESCRIPTION
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a wrapper around GnuPG and a text editor, it includes a full-screen
pager with timeout (avoids passwords from lingering on screen) and a
password generator with profiles.
.Pp
The following options are global and apply to all the subsequent commands:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl c Ar config
Use an alternate configuration file.
.It Fl V
Print version.
.It Fl h
Print general usage. For command-specific usage, this flag should
be placed after the command name, for example 'mdp edit -h'.

.Op Fl n Ar count

.Ek
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
Add passwords to the end of the password file. This command is an alias
for 'generate' and 'edit' with the added advantage of not requiring any
copy-paste. All the arguments to this command will be used as prefix in the
password file (with the exception of the options starting with '-').
.Pp
The options for the 'add' command are the same as the 'edit' and the 'generate'
command.
.Ed
.\" mdp edit
.Pp
.Nm mdp
.Bk -words
.Ar edit
.Op Fl h
.Op Fl k Ar keyid
.Ek
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
Edit the password file (decrypt and re-encrypt after the fact).
This command creates a temporary file in the same folder as the
password file and starts the editor, if the file is changed, the
file is fed to GnuPG when the editor exits.
.Pp
The only option for the 'edit' command is:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl k Ar key_id
The argument is a GnuPG key id (8 alpha-numeric characters), it could be used
to specify a key id in case it wasn't defined in the configuration file.
.El

.\" mdp generate
.Pp
.Nm mdp
.Bk -words
.Ar generate
.Op Fl h
.Op Fl p Ar profile
.Op Fl n Ar count
.Op Fl l Ar length
.Ek
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
Generate password(s) according to the configuration or command-line
arguments.  Without profile specified, mdp uses the top-level
definitions for the character set, password length and count (see
CONFIGURATION below). All the flags specified on the command-line
will override the ones specified in the profile or top-level
definitions. This command can be shortened as 'gen'.
.Pp
The options for the generate command are:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl p Ar profile
Choose which profile to use among the ones defined in the configuration
file.
.It Fl n Ar count
Number of passwords to generate. This command line parameter will
override all other values of password_count (global and profile).
.It Fl l Ar length
Length of generated passwords (in characters). This command line
parameter will override all other values of password_count (global
and profile).
.El
.Ed
.\" mdp get
.Pp
.Nm mdp
.Bk -words
.Ar get
.Op Fl hEr
.Ar keywords ...
.Ek
.Bd -ragged -offset indent
Return all the password entries matching the given keywords or
regexes (if using -E). By default, this command will open a full-screen
pager to display search results, the time the pager remains on
screen is adjustable in the configuration file. Note that hitting
'/' on the result screen will start another search.
.Pp
The options for the get command are:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl E
Use regexes instead of plain text matches (e.g. ^.mail).
.It Fl r
Displays the result without pager, plain terminal dump to stdout.
This option should be used sparingly since the password will linger
on screen and in terminal history/buffer.
.El
.Ed
.\" mdp prompt
.Pp
.Nm mdp
.Bk -words
.Ar prompt
.Op Fl hE
.Ek
.Bd -ragged -offset indent -compact
Starts a full-screen pager with search prompt. This command is
useful to avoid passing the search keywords in the command line
(and allowing all users in the system to see what passwords are
requested). Since it uses the default pager, multiple searches can
be conducted using the '/' key. Any other key will exit the pager,
it will also exit after a configurable timer. The search keywords
will be interpreted as regexes if the -E option is used (see mdp
get).

.\" QUICK WALKTHROUGH
.Sh QUICK WALKTHROUGH
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It 1. Create a GPG key if needed.
.It 2. Create a .mdp/config file from the example (with at least gpg_key_id).
.It 3. Either define EDITOR env variable or add editor to the config file.
.It 4. Pick a password from randomly generated ones, for example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
mdp gen
.Ed
.It 5. Run "mdp edit" and add a line such as:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
twitter sponge@bob.com yHVHPnqXyx6qUuki
.Ed
.It 6. This is how the Twitter password is requested:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
mdp get twitter
.Ed
.El
.\" CONFIGURATION
.Sh CONFIGURATION
This is an alphabetically sorted summary of all the available configuration
variables and options:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Ic set backup Ar no
Define whether we keep a backup every time we edit the password file. Default:
yes.
.Pp
.It Ic set character_count Ar count
Define how many characters to randomize per password. Default: 16 or as defined
in the profile.
.Pp
.It Ic set character_set Ar characters
Define all the characters to use in passwords. Default: all alphanumeric
(upper and lower case) or as define in the profile. The following aliases are
supported as shortcuts: $LOWERCASE, $UPPERCASE, $ALPHA, $DIGITS, $ALPHANUMERIC,
$SYMBOLS, $PRINTABLE.
.Pp
.It Ic set editor Ar path
Command to start the text editor. It's considered better practice
to define an $EDITOR environment variable. If
.Nm
detects vim, it will attempt to add the -n parameter to avoid vim
from creating swap files.
.Pp
.It Ic set gpg_key_id Ar key_id
GnuPG key id (default: none). If no key is selected,
.Nm
will expect a key specified on the command-line (-k). If no key was
specified either way,
.Nm
will abort. That this parameter is ignored during the decryption
phase, GnuPG picks the key based on the content of the password
file.
.Pp
.It Xo Ic set gpg_path Ar path
.Xc
GnuPG absolute path (default: /usr/bin/gpg)
.Pp
.It Ic set gpg_timeout Ar seconds
Number of seconds to give GnuPG for password and pipe interaction. The
default value is 10 seconds. This will kill GnuPG if forgotten at the password
prompt or if it cannot communicate with the parent process.
.Pp
.It Ic set password_count Ar count
Define how many password to show with using 'mdp gen'. Default: 4 or as defined
in the profile.
.Pp
.It Ic set password_file Ar filepath
Sets the location of the password file. mdp will refuse to use a password file
with permissions other than 0600 in a repertory with permissions other than 0700.
The default value for this is ~/.mdp/passwords.
.Pp
.It Ic set timeout Ar seconds
This variable define how long the pager will display search results.
The default value is 10 seconds.
.Nm
will use your default editor (as defined by $EDITOR). 
.It Ic profile Ar name
All the variables define below a profile header will be specific to this
profile. For now only password_count, character_count and character_set are
valid options.
.El
.\" PASSWORD FILE
.Sh PASSWORD FILE
The password file should be structured to allow mdp to query it,
since it works similarly to grep, one line per password is ideal.
For example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
nameOfServiceA   password1
anotherService   password2
.Ed
.Pp
The keywords used for search and the passwords can be separated
with anything except for new-line (\\n), allowing services to be
found by names:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
mdp serviceA
.Ed
.Pp
Any convenient number of namespacing hints can be used to add
hierarchy, the following allows all 'email' passwords to be returned
at once:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
email     serviceA       password1
email     serviceB       password2
irc       serviceC       password3
.Ed
.Pp
Using '#' in the beginning of a line will avoid mdp from displaying
this line during searches.  This is particularly useful to add meta
data to the password file or keep track of previous password without
adding noise to the output. For example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# email services
serviceA     password1
serviceB     password2

# irc servers
serviceC     password3
.Ed
.Pp
Empty lines are naturally ignored.
.Sh SECURITY
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Why not 'shred' the temporary file?
If the disk can be stollen, it should be encrypted. Shred has limited
use on most journaled file-systems.
.It What if 'root' cannot be trusted?
The machine cannot be trusted if you cannot trust its administrator.
.It What if my server is virtualized?
Same answer as above, if the hosting provider or Iaas cannot be
trusted, the machine in their facility cannot be trusted.

.Bl -tag
.It Pa $HOME/.mdp/config
Main configuration file for
.Nm .
.It Pa $HOME/.mdp/passwords
Encrypted list of passwords.
.It Pa $HOME/.mdp/passwords.bak
This file is a copy of the password file, before the last edit. The
current password file can be replaced by the backup to discard the
last changes. Setting 'set backup false' in the configuration file
disables the creation of the backup file.
.It Pa $HOME/.mdp/lock
This file is created while the password file is loaded in the editor.
It avoids two copies of mdp to run at the same time for the same user.
