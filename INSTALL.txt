mdp - installation notes
========================

REQUIREMENTS
    - GCC or clang (recent enough to compile C99).
    - GnuPG configured with a working key. Have a look at the following URL if
      you are not sure how to configure GnuPG:

        http://www.dewinter.com/gnupg_howto/english/GPGMiniHowto-3.html

    - On most Linux distribution, ncurses headers and wide-char libraries need
      to be installed as well.

    The following will install most of the requirements on your average Ubuntu
    or Debian system::

        apt-get install libncursesw5-dev libncursesw5 gnupg

    On most Unices:

        ./configure
        make
        sudo make install

    But also, on macOS using Homebrew:

        brew install tamentis/core/mdp
